                       "HOWTO" FOR GO DOCTOR DEVELOPERS


INSTALL THE GO DOCTOR BINARY---------------------------------------------------

Assuming that you have checked out the Go Doctor sources (as described below),
all the tests pass (also described below), and your working directory is
$GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor/godoctor, run this command:

    go install github.com/godoctor/godoctor/cmd/godoctor


RUN TESTS----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following commands assume your working directory is
$GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor/godoctor

To run all tests for all packages:
    go test ./...               # Be patient!  It may take a while

To run tests for refactorings only:
    cd refactoring
    go test                     # To run all tests for all refactorings
    go test -filter=rename      # E.g., to test a specific refactoring
    go test -filter=rename/023  # E.g., to run a particular test


UPDATE GO.TOOLS----------------------------------------------------------------

The easy way:
    go get -u golang.org/x/tools

The less easy way:
    cd $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/tools
    hg pull
    hg update


CHECK CODE COVERAGE FOR A TEST-------------------------------------------------

See http://blog.golang.org/cover

To display just the percentage of code covered:
    go test -cover

To open a Web browser showing individual lines covered/not covered:
    go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out


VIEW GODOC IN YOUR BROWSER-----------------------------------------------------

Viewing the Go Doctor's GoDoc is a good way to check that a package's API is
sane, since it lets you see each package as a third-party developer would.

In a shell, start the godoc server in the background:
    godoc -http :8080 &
Wait a minute for it to load (if your workspace is huge)
Browse to http://localhost:8080/pkg/github.com/godoctor
When you don't need it anymore, shut down the godoc server:
    killall godoc

If you have Go 1.3, you can add type analysis:
    godoc -analysis type -http :8080 &


GIT STUFF----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not intended to teach you how to use Git.  It's only meant to give a
sense of the workflows that we use and the exact syntax of the Git commands
involved.

The commands below assume that you are running Linux or Mac OS X.  Some of
these commands will not work under Windows; others require modifications (e.g.,
changing $GOPATH to %GOPATH%).

The Git commands in most of these scenarios will require your working directory
to be $GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor/godoctor.


SET NAME/E-MAIL USED BY GIT

    After you install Git for the first time, you will need to configure your
    name and e-mail address, which will be associated with your commits.

        $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
        $ git config --global user.email "username@auburn.edu"

    A nice idea from http://fredkschott.com/post/2014/02/git-log-is-so-2005/
    is to configure a "git lg" command that displays the git log in a more
    compact, readable form that better illustrates branching structure:

        $ git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"


CLONING THE GO DOCTOR GIT REPOSITORY

    The source code for the Go Doctor should be stored in
    $GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor.  You will need Mercurial to get go.tools
    and Git to get everything else.  To set up a development workspace:

        $ go get golang.org/x/tools
        $ go get github.com/willf/bitset
        $ git clone https://github.com/godoctor/godoctor.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor
        $ git config branch.autosetuprebase always
        $ git config branch.master.rebase true

    Instead of the last two lines, you can get all dependencies automatically:

        $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor
        $ go get -u -v ./...    # To get dependencies, including go.tools

    If you have your own fork of the GitHub repository, you will want to store
    it locally in $GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor so that you do not have to
    manually change all of the import paths.  Instead of the "git clone" line
    above, use this:

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_github_username/godoctor.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/godoctor


DEVELOPING A NEW FEATURE

    New features and bug fixes should be developed in branches.  This allows
    them to be reviewed, tested, and revised before they are moved into the
    production Go Doctor branch (the "master" branch).

    To create a new branch called "devel-something" for a new feature you intend
    to work on,

        $ git pull origin master
        $ git checkout -b devel-something origin/master

    Note that the "devel-something" branch exists only on your local machine.
    It's not on the server.  If you want to share it on the server, you can
    (we'll get to that later), but you don't have to.

    To list the branches that are currently available on your machine:

        $ git branch

    In the output, the starred branch is the one you're currently working on.
    If you just created the devel-something branch, it is probably that.  To
    switch back to the master branch, use

        $ git checkout master

    and likewise, to switch back to your development branch,

        $ git checkout devel-something

    Commit frequently to your branch.  Every time you make a significant
    change, commit.  Commit, commit, commit.  Git makes it easy to undo
    everything since your last commit, and you can even revert specific
    commits.  One of the main advantages of using a version control system is
    that it makes it easy to "jump back" to any previous point in time (as long
    as you have a commit that records what the project looked like at that
    point in time).

    Eventually, there will be changes in the master branch that you need to
    integrate into your development work.  To do that,

    1. Use "git branch" to make sure you're on the right (development) branch.
    2. Commit any outstanding changes.  If you still have work to do, that's
       fine.  You're on a branch, so you can continue fixing things later and
       make more commits to your branch.  The commit just records what your
       project looked like at this point in time.  So, if something goes
       horribly wrong, you can always "go back in time" and make your project
       look exactly the same way it does right now.
    3. Use "git pull" to integrate the changes from the master branch:
        $ git pull origin master

    Then, continue making changes, making commits, and periodically
    integrating the changes from the master branch until you're done.

    When you're ready to share your development branch on the server (e.g., so
    others can try out your code), make sure you've pulled in the latest
    changes from the master branch (as above), then

        $ git push origin devel-something:devel-something

    After sharing your branch on the server, when you make new commits to your
    branch, you can use "git push" to push those commits to the server.


EDITOR INTEGRATION-------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to integrate the Go Doctor into a text editor or IDE: using
the OpenRefactory JSON protocol, or by invoking the godoctor directly and
parsing standard output and error.


               INTEGRATION USING THE OPENREFACTORY JSON PROTOCOL


When the OpenRefactory JSON protocol is used, a text editor or IDE (the
"client") engages in a dialog with the Go Doctor (the "server").  The client
sends a command, and the server replies; the client sends another command, and
the server replies.  Both commands and replies are in JSON format.

The OpenRefactory protocol is documented at FIXME: URL

When the Go Doctor is invoked with the --json command-line argument, it acts as
an OpenRefactory protocol server, reading commands from standard input (one per
line) and writing replies to standard output.  It continues reading commands
until it reaches the end of input, an error occurs, or the close command is
issued.

An example dialog follows:

    $ godoctor --json
    stdin>    { "command": "open", "version": 0.1 }
    stdout>   {"reply":"OK"}
    stdin>    {"command": "list", "quality": "in_testing"}
    stdout>   {"reply":"OK","transformations":[{"name":"Rename","shortName":"rename"},{"name":"Toggle var \u003c-\u003e :=","shortName":"toggle"},{"name":"Add GoDoc","shortName":"godoc"}]}
    stdin>    {"command":"close"}

Unfortunately, some clients cannot reasonably operate in this way -- writing a
command, reading a reply, then writing another command, and reading another
reply.  Vim is one such example.  Its ability to perform interprocess
communication is extremely limited: it can execute a shell command and read its
output.

To accommodate clients like this, the --json flag can be followed by a JSON
array containing a list of commands (excluding open and close commands, which
are implied).  For example:

    $ godoctor --json '[ {"command": "setdir", "mode": "local", "directory": "/temp"}, {"command": "list", "quality": "in_testing" } ]'

Equivalently, the --json flag can be followed by "-", and the JSON array can be
provided on standard input:

    $ godoctor --json -
    stdin>    [ {"command": "setdir", "mode": "local", "directory": "/temp"}, {"command": "list", "quality": "in_testing" } ]

When an array of commands is given, the commands are executed in order.  If one
of the commands fails, an error or failure reply is returned, and the server
terminates.  If no commands fail, the reply to the last command is returned,
and the server terminates.

For more details, see the OpenRefactory Protocol Specification.


          AD HOC INTEGRATION USING THE GODOCTOR COMMAND LINE INTERFACE


The Vim integration supplied with the Go Doctor does not use the OpenRefactory
JSON protocol, in order to avoid the need for a JSON parser.  Instead, it runs
the godoctor executable directly.  The godoctor writes to standard output and
standard error in a reasonably regular format; the Vim plug-in parses this
output to provide "good enough" editor integration.

The following describes, at a high level, how the Vim plug-in executes the
godoctor binary and interprets its output.

(1) List available refactorings

    $ godoctor --list
Refactoring    	Description                                    	     Multifile?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rename         	Changes the name of an identifier                 	true
toggle         	Toggles between a var declaration and := statement	false
godoc          	Adds stub GoDoc comments where they are missing   	false

    The output of this command has two header lines.  Each subsequent line
    contains three tab-separated fields.  The first is a short name for a
    refactoring.  The second is a brief synopsis (≤ 50 characters).  The third
    field is "false" if the refactoring is guaranteed to affect only the file
    containing the selection; if other files may be affected as well, this
    field is "true".

(2) Display usage information for a refactoring (e.g., rename)

    $ godoctor rename
Usage: rename <new_name>

    The output of this command should be a single line containing a brief
    synopsis of the refactoring's arguments, suitable for display to the user.

(3) Perform a refactoring

    There are several options for performing a refactoring.

    (A) Input: Files vs. Standard Input

        Usually, the file to refactor and the text selection in that file are
        provided by passing -file and -pos flags to the godoctor executable.

        $ godoctor -file main.go -pos 1,9:1,9 rename foo

        (Note that the -pos flag can provide either a line/column selection or
        an offset/length selection; see godoctor --help for details.)

        If the -file flag is omitted, or if "-" is passed as the filename, then
        the Go Doctor will read source code from standard input and refactor
        that source code.  For example:

        $ echo "package main" | godoctor -file - -pos 1,9:1,12 rename foo
Defaulting to file scope for refactoring (provide an explicit scope to change this)
<stdin>:1:9: Error: cannot rename main function inside main package ,it eliminates the program entry 							point
    
    (B) Output: Diff vs. Complete Files

        When a refactoring is run, the Go Doctor's output is as follows:
            1. An error log is written to standard error.  Errors, warnings,
	       and informational messages are written in a GCC-like format.
               Note that some messages may have an associated filename and line
               number, while others may not.
	    2. The output of the refactoring (a diff, or a list of the affected
               files' modified contents) is written to standard output.

        By default, the Go Doctor will output a patch file that can be applied
        using GNU patch or a similar program.

        $ echo "package main; var n int = 3" | godoctor -pos 18,1 rename nnn
Defaulting to package scope example for refactoring (provide an explicit scope to change this)
diff -u /dev/stdin /dev/stdout
--- /dev/stdin
+++ /dev/stdout
@@ -1,1 +1,1 @@
-package main; var n int = 3
+package main; var nnn int = 3

	Alternatively, if the -complete flag is given, the Go Doctor will
        output the entire contents of all files affected by the refactoring.

        $ echo "package main; var n int = 3" | godoctor -complete -pos 18,1 rename nnn
Defaulting to package scope example for refactoring (provide an explicit scope to change this)
@@@@@ /dev/stdin @@@@@ 30 @@@@@
package main; var nnn int = 3

        When the -complete flag is given, each line of the form
            @@@@@@ filename @@@@@ bytes_in_modified_file @@@@@
        marks the start of a file.  The subsequent lines, up to the next such
        line or the end of input, are the refactored contents of that file.

        When standard output and error are combined, as in

            $ echo "package main; var n int = 3" | \
              godoctor -complete -pos 18,1 rename nnn 2>&1

        the error log is output first, and the first @@@@@ line marks the
        beginning of the modifications made by the refactoring.  No error
        messages should follow the first @@@@@ line.

	Note that, when files are parsed from the -complete output, there is no
        way to determine whether the file contained a newline at the end of the
        file.  The Vim plug-in assumes that all files should end with a
        trailing newline.
