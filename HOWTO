                       "HOWTO" FOR GO DOCTOR DEVELOPERS


CHECK OUT THE GO DOCTOR FROM GIT-----------------------------------------------

mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/golang-refactoring.org
cd $GOPATH/src/golang-refactoring.org
git clone ssh://username@git.golang-refactoring.org/gitroot/go-doctor.git
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "username@auburn.edu"
git config branch.autosetuprebase always
git config branch.master.rebase true
cd go-doctor
go get -u -v     # To get dependencies


RUN TESTS----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following commands assume your working directory is
$GOPATH/src/golang-refactoring.org/go-doctor

To run all tests for all packages:
    go test ./...               # Be patient!  It may take a while

To run tests for refactorings:
    cd refactoring
    go test                     # To run all tests for all refactorings
    go test -filter=rename      # E.g., to test a specific refactoring
    go test -filter=rename/023  # E.g., to run a particular test


UPDATE GO.TOOLS----------------------------------------------------------------

cd $GOPATH/src/code.google.com/p/go.tools
hg pull
hg update


CHECK CODE COVERAGE FOR A TEST-------------------------------------------------

See http://blog.golang.org/cover

To display just the percentage of code covered:
    go test -cover

To open a Web browser showing individual lines covered/not covered:
    go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out


VIEW GODOC IN YOUR BROWSER-----------------------------------------------------

Viewing the Go Doctor's GoDoc is a good way to check that a package's API is
sane, since it lets you see each package as a third-party developer would.

In a shell, start the godoc server in the background:
    godoc -http :8080 &
Wait a minute for it to load (if your workspace is huge)
Browse to http://localhost:8080/pkg/golang-refactoring.org/
When you don't need it anymore, shut down the godoc server:
    killall godoc


GIT STUFF----------------------------------------------------------------------

Update information about what branches, commits, etc. are on the server, but
don't change anything locally:
    git fetch

List branches that you have locally:
    git branch

List branches available on the server:
    git branch -r

Check out a development branch on the server that you do not yet have locally:
    git checkout --track origin/devel-whatever

Switch to a development branch you already checked out:
    git checkout devel-whatever

Update your development branch with changes from the server's master branch
(assuming you have your development branch checked out):
    git fetch
    git merge origin/master

Switch back to your local copy of the master branch
(assuming you have your development branch checked out):
    git checkout master
    (Note: You must stash or commit local changes before doing this)

Create a development branch for a new feature
(assuming the master branch is currently checked out):
    git checkout -b devel-something

Create a development branch on the server from your local development branch
(assuming your development branch is currently checked out):
    git push origin devel-something

Merge a local development branch into master, when a new feature is done:
    git checkout master
    git pull . devel-something

Delete a local development branch when you don't need it anymore
(assuming master or some other branch is currently checked out):
    git branch -d devel-something

Delete a development branch from the server
(e.g., when the feature has been integrated into the master branch):
    git push origin :devel-something
